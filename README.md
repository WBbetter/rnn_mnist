# Recurrent Neural Network for the MNIST Database
This project is about creating neural network for image classification with the MNIST database. It doesn't use a ram intensive convolutional neural network, but rather a recurrent neural network.
# Language and Framework
The model is built in Google's Tensorflow and python 2.7.
# Performance
Best current performance is at 99.33% and really good for a recurrent neural network.
Performance can be enhanced by creating a bigger dataset through elastic distortions(currently in process with infimnist, see this folder) or by growing the size of the network. Both methods require more performance and this computationally intensive training of the neural network is currently this' projects problem.
